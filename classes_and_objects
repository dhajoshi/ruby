What's and Object ?

It's just a bunch of Instance variables, puls a link to a class.
The object's methods dont live in the objects - they live in the 
object's class, where they are called instace method of the call.

what's a class ?

it's just an object plus, a list of instance methods and a link to
a superclass. Class is a subclass of Module, so a class is also 
a module

Like any object, a class has it's own methods such as new(), these
are instance methods of the Class class. also like any object classe must
access through references, you already have constance reference to each 
class: a class's name
